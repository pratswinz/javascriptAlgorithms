Write a NodeJS API which takes a dictionary file (eg: `dictionary.txt`) as an input and does the following:

Example, imagine the `dictionary.txt` file contained the following words:

```
Chic
Car
Lottery
Ken
Man
Chicken
Post
Paper
Postman
```

Your program needs to return two word combinations that when joined together, returns another word which is also in the dictionary.

Example output:

```
Chic + Ken = Chicken
Post + Man = Postman
etc...
```
